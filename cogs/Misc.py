- Server ID's, Channel ID's, User ID's will be saved for the use of features such as Mutes, verification etc.

Why this information is stored and how we use it.
- This information is stored to keep the bot with the most up to date info that allows it to keep running it's correct service.
- The mute data is stored temporarily and is used to check when the mute is supposed to end, or if you're supposed to be muted if you join or leave.

Who gets this data?
- The bot developer(s).
- If you're muted then your mute data will be formed into something readable by the `Moderations` command and this can be seen by any server staff member.

How to remove your data.
- If you'd like to get your servers data out of the bot then please either use the correct commands if given an option or contact the bot developer (kal#1806) for more information."""
